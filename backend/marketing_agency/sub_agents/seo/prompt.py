       - Include competitor weaknesses that can be exploited on each platform
    
    3. BLOG IDEAS: If 'blog' is requested, generate:
       - 5 blog post titles with SEO-friendly structures
       - Keyword density recommendations for each blog topic
       - Content outline with H2 and H3 suggestions

       - 3-5 compelling ad headlines and descriptions for PPC campaigns
       - Recommended keywords to bid on
       - Unique selling propositions to highlight based on competitor gaps
    
    For each item, focus on:
    - Including relevant keywords naturally
    - Maintaining the brand voice
    - Addressing customer pain points identified in the research
    - Differentiating from competitors with specific strategies
    - Regional considerations when applicable
