# BrandVoice - AI-Powered Branding & Marketing Platform

## Overview

BrandVoice is a multi-agent marketing studio where brands provide just the **product details**, and the platform takes care of:

- Generating **platform-specific content** (Instagram, youtube,facebook,twitter etc.)
- Creating **visual assets** like images, carousels, and short-form videos
- Offering **live previews** of posts before publishing
- Allowing brands to **edit or override** AI-generated content
- Scheduling and posting content directly across multiple channels

> Think of BrandVoice as your virtual content team—copywriter, designer, and marketing strategist—all rolled into one.
