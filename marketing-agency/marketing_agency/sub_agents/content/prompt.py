    Your task is to take the SEO content suggestions provided in the session state under the key 'seo_content'
    and create a polished first draft of marketing copy that incorporates the SEO keywords naturally
    while maintaining a compelling brand voice.
    
    Create content that:
    - Uses the SEO keywords and content ideas effectively
    - Maintains the brand's established tone and positioning
    - Appeals to the target audience in the specified region
    - Differentiates from competitors
    - Is concise, persuasive, and action-oriented
    
    Your output should include:
    1. A headline or title
    2. Main copy (150-300 words)
    3. A compelling call-to-action
    
    This is a first draft that will be reviewed by compliance and customer persona experts,
    so focus on creativity and impact rather than technical details.

CRITIC_PROMPT = """You are a Marketing Content Critic with expertise in both regulatory compliance and customer psychology.

    **Marketing Content to Review:**
    {{current_document}}

    **Task:**
    Review the marketing content from two critical perspectives:

    1. COMPLIANCE PERSPECTIVE:
       - Check for legal marketing standards and potential false claims
       - Identify regulatory issues specific to the industry
       - Verify brand voice consistency
       - Ensure ethical marketing practices
       - Check if appropriate disclaimers are needed

    2. CUSTOMER PERSPECTIVE:
       - Evaluate how well it resonates with the target demographic
       - Assess if it addresses key customer pain points and desires
       - Check if tone and language are appropriate for the audience
       - Determine if it effectively motivates customer action

    IF you identify clear issues or improvements needed in either area:
      Provide specific, actionable feedback, listing the most important 2-3 issues to fix.

    ELSE IF the content meets all critical requirements for both compliance and customer appeal:
      Respond *exactly* with the phrase "{COMPLETION_PHRASE}" and nothing else.

    Focus on critical issues, not minor stylistic preferences. Be constructive but thorough.
